<h3>Hey Measurement Canada!</h3>

<p>We hope you are all doing well and staying safe in this unprecedented time. We’re excited to 
give you another quick update about our project and what we’ve been up to so far.</p>

<p>In the past two months, we have been focusing on gaining a better understanding of the challenges that Measurement Canada employees are facing on a regular basis. 
We spoke with over twenty individuals from various roles, seniority, disciplines and regions to better understand the types of pain points. 
After summarizing and consolidating similar problems, we conducted an environmental scan to learn of other initiatives being pursued outside of the fellowship that may solve these particular problems. 
This helped us get an idea of potential blockers and enablers associated with the different problem spaces. While this phase has taken a significant amount of time, it is an absolutely critical step to help us deliver the most value to Measurement Canada employees. 
We want to take this opportunity to thank everyone for their time and support to help us get to where we are today!</p>

<p>When it came time to decide on which direction we wanted to take, we asked ourselves a couple of key questions:
  <ol class="pg-list">
    <li>
      What is the initial cause of the problem? 
    </li>
     <li>
      Is it something that could be solved through technology or does it require a change from a policy or regulatory standpoint? 
    </li>
    <li>
      How many people are affected by the problem?</li>
    <li>
      Is it within our capacity to solve it, can we in the next six to seven months provide value to the people struggling with that issue and help them? 
    </li>
</p>
 
<p>
  We answered these questions by using a three-star ranking system (the more the better) to help us quantify each of these pillars to guide our decision making. From this, our research revealed that we could deliver the most value by focusing on the pain points of the inspectors (E&G and W&M); specifically, the logistical planning and coordination phase of the inspection process. 
</p>
 
<p>
  We broke up this problem space into two specific problem statements. Initially, we will start with the first problem statement. This problem statement focuses on the scheduling and logistical aspects of planning their inspections.

<p>
The second problem statement focuses on the procurement of the necessary equipment and coordination with neighbouring inspectors to ensure proper coverage.
</p>

<p>These two problem statements will not only help inspectors do their jobs more efficiently but also help district inspectors, regional and district managers streamline their workflow. The symbiotic relationship between the two problems also gives us a better chance of tackling them much more easily.
</br>If you have any questions about how we came to this decision or want to learn more about our process check out the article we wrote for the Code for Canada blog. You can also shoot us an email or msg us on Microsoft Teams!
