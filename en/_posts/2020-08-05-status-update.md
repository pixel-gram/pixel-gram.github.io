<h3>Hey Measurement Canada!</h3>

<p>Over the past few months, we have been working collaboratively with various groups to help us design a digital solution that will help inspectors streamline their workload planning process. In this post, we will be highlighting some of the key milestones and processes we used to get there.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Collaborating with user panels</h2>
<p>A user panel is a group of subject matter experts (SMEs) that advises on and contributes to the design and functionality of a product. It is also a representative sample of the entire user population that the product is built for. For our purposes, we created two user panels to reflect the needs of both weights and measures, and electricity and gas inspectors. Among the employees who expressed interest in our baseline study, we selected 29 to serve as SMEs to help us build our digital solution. Here is the breakdown of the two user panels:</p>

<p>On a biweekly basis, we use Microsoft Teams to engage with our user panels and share our designs, thought processes and assumptions, and actively listen to the feedback given to us. Through multiple iterations, we collaboratively designed a prototype that helps inspectors efficiently create and maintain an organized inspection task planner.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Solution demo</h2>
<p>With our prototype complete, we have begun our engineering work! While Noor, our development fellow, works diligently on this, we wanted to demonstrate how it works in the context of two inspection scenarios: complaints and disputes.</p>

<h3 class="section-heading">Complaints</h3>
<p>In this scenario, a weights and measures inspector is organizing their workload and notices that complaints have been assigned to them. With the integration of multiple data sources, the inspector is able to quickly review critical information and decide when to perform the inspection.</p>

<p>While designing our solution, we wanted to make sure inspectors were empowered to have full control over their own schedule, but also have enough flexibility to adapt to changes. We accomplished this by introducing the concept of “batches”. A batch is a group of inspections to be completed that is organized and maintained by the inspector. The inspector will have the ability to dynamically modify the batch, and set an effective date for the batch.</p>

<h3 class="section-heading">Disputes</h3>
<p>In this scenario, an electricity and gas inspector is organizing their workload and notices that disputes have been assigned to them. Similar to the previous scenario, the inspector is able to quickly review critical information and decide when to perform the inspection.</p>

<img class="img-fluid img_border" src="/img/posts/blog6/disputessdemo.gif" alt="Disputes demo">

<p>A key difference here is that electricity and gas inspectors require more coordination with the utility and authorized service provider (ASP) technicians. For this reason, we provided inspectors the ability to indicate exactly the day and time the inspection will take place. The schedule is then automatically created, based on the inspection date.</p>

<h3 class="section-heading">Solution rollout strategy</h3>
<p>Looking ahead, we are positioned to have a functional prototype of our digital solution deployed into the cloud to enable inspectors to test it towards the end of our fellowship. There will be two environment stages: user acceptance testing (UAT) and production. All new features will be deployed for testing. If things function as expected, we will roll out the solution into production for all inspectors to use.</p>
