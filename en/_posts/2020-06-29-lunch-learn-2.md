<h3>Hey Measurement Canada!</h3>

<p>
We hope you are all doing well and staying safe. Last month we hosted our second lunch and learn, and we’d like to thank everyone for their continued support.
  
At the lunch and learn, we shared some useful tips and tools for working productively from home. Because some of you weren't able to join us, we will be highlighting the discussion in this post. You can also view the full deck here! 

Before we jump into the meat and potatoes, we want to acknowledge that:
</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote" style="text-align:center;">Not everything presented here will work for everyone and that’s okay!</blockquote>

<p>
The tips and tools suggested in this post are those that have worked for us, but are by no means definitive answers. If some of them don't work for you, keep experimenting to find the ones that do!
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Part 1: Tips on working from home</h2>
<h3 class="section-heading">Communicate, communicate, communicate!</h3>

<img class="img-fluid img_border" src="/img/posts/blog5/talking.gif" alt="Communication is key">
<p>
Clear communication is very important when working from home. Unlike the office environment, everyone is working in their own space, making collaboration and communication a lot harder. 

To help mitigate this issue, we suggest using one primary channel of communication within your team with established core hours. This way, everyone knows how and when to reach everyone else.

When you want to meet with your colleagues, it’s best to do so over a video conference so that you don’t lose the nuances of facial expression and body language that you usually get when speaking to them in person. We highly suggest using your smartphone or personal computer for video calls to avoid overloading the GCSRA network. Using Microsoft Teams for your virtual meeting is an excellent option, as it doesn’t require a connection to GCSRA. 

When working remotely from home, communication tends to be intermittent as people are often not available at the same time. Therefore, it’s best to over communicate and follow up frequently with colleagues. It's also important that everyone is aware of when their teammates are available and when they aren’t. 
</p>

<h3 class="section-heading">Imitate the office!</h3>

<img class="img-fluid img_border" src="img/posts/blog5/office_2.gif" alt="Imitating the office">

<p>
When working from home, we lose a lot of the day-to-day routine and social interactions that we had when working from the office. Many people really love the flexibility that comes with working remotely, especially in the early stages; however, the lack of structure and routine can begin weighing heavily as time goes on. 

What I found has helped me is pretending that I am going into the office. For me, this means wearing nicer clothes, which is of tremendous help to get me into the “I'm going to go to work” mindset. 

It also helps to create a comfortable workspace, ideally at a table or desk in an area with as little distraction and as much privacy as possible. This not only helps to stay productive, but it helps set a clearer boundary between personal and professional activities and can prevent overworking and burnout.
 
Last, but not least, to make up for the lack of socializing, we highly encourage you to reach out to your coworkers for impromptu chats or to schedule lunches so you can catch up. 
</p>

<h3 class="section-heading">Stay productive and focused!</h3>

<img class="img-fluid img_border" src="img/posts/blog5/focus_2.gif" alt="Staying productive and focused">

<p>
It’s so easy to get distracted when working from home, especially if there are other family members present.

When I first started working from home, I found it very hard to focus and get into the work mindset. What helped me was having a daily list of tasks that needed to get done and completing them one by one. 

It’s important to set up a daily routine to create habits that make it easier over time to get into and out of work mode. My morning ritual, for example, is to have a cup of tea, check in with my teammates and then play some music to get into the work mindset. 

It also helps to take breaks throughout the day to give your brain a few minutes to refresh itself.
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Part 2: Tools for working from home</h2>
<p>
Here are three tools that can help you work more effectively while working from home:

<ul>
  <li>Microsoft Teams</li>
  <li>Miro</li>
  <li>FunRetro</li>
</ul>

Each of these tools promote collaborative workflow between teams, particularly for dispersed teams. Before using them for work, please make sure to check with your managers that they are compliant with ISED’s requirements.
</p>

<h3 class="section-heading">Microsoft Teams</h3>

<p>
Microsoft Teams is a tool that focuses on seamless communication and collaboration within a team. Instead of emailing each other, you can message and video call everyone on your team from one place, and create a team channel where everyone can reach each other.

Microsoft Teams can also function as a task manager. The planning feature can be used to organize team tasks, and dispersed team members can view all the tasks that need to be completed and what everyone is working on, providing transparency to the team.

Lastly, the tool is built in with other Office 365 desktop software and external apps (e.g. Word, Excel, PowerPoint) and allows you to access your files from OneDrive.

For our fellowship, Microsoft Teams has been the primary tool for communication between fellows and our government partners. We run our daily check-ins and weekly meetings with partners on Microsoft Teams. It was also our tool of choice during our research phase, when we needed to connect with other Measurement Canada staff outside of Ottawa.

<h3 class="section-heading">Miro</h3>

<p>
Miro is an amazing tool that helps facilitate live virtual collaboration. Its biggest strength is its ability to imitate real-life collaboration. It allows you to work and collaborate with multiple people at once in real time, as shown in the GIF below. 

What makes Miro so intuitive are its strong collaborative features, such as its screen sharing and presentation modes, which allows users to share and present the work they do directly from the application. When using these modes, everyone can see in real time what others are working on, leave comments to provide their feedback or have discussions using the built-in chat, if needed. When using this tool, it feels like everyone is in the same room! 

Miro is a very flexible tool that you and your team can use to hold brainstorming sessions, collaborate on workflows and even work through any issues that you are trying to resolve.

In our process so far, Miro has been one of the tools we have used to help us with the documentation and synthesis of our research data. The use of digital sticky notes really helped us brainstorm ideas and potential directions for the project.
</p>

<h3 class="section-heading">FunRetro</h3>

<p>
FunRetro is a tool we used to facilitate our end-of-sprint retrospectives and foster collaboration within our team.

Retrospectives are a fun and effective way for teams to understand how they are performing, what they are doing well, what they aren't doing well and how they can improve in the future. It’s a great way to help teams improve and to foster stronger team dynamics.

Since working from home full time, our team has been using FunRetro exclusively to conduct our retrospectives. The biggest benefit we got from this tool was the enormous amount of templates it provided that empowered us to engage with each other in different ways every time!
</p>

<h3 class="section-heading">You still don’t feel comfortable working remotely?</h3>
<p>
It’s okay if you are still uncomfortable working remotely. If you haven’t done it before, it can be hard to adjust, especially since the shift to working from home in March was so abrupt. These past few months have been stressful, so give yourself the time to develop new habits and routines that will help you be more productive when working from home. 

I have also included some helpful links for those who want to learn more:

This <a href="https://wordpress.com/blog/2020/03/20/remote-work-reader/">compilation of articles</a> was written by staff at Automatic (the company behind Wordpress.com). They have been working remotely for the past decade and have great insights on how to get more comfortable with it. Most of these articles reference their insights! Here are some highlights:

Thanks again to everyone who attended the lunch and learn; we really appreciated it! If you have any questions about working remotely, please feel free to shoot us an email or message us on Microsoft Teams.
