<h3>Hey everyone!</h3>

<p>We are thrilled to share that a group of legal metrologists have begun experimenting with using agile practices into their daily work! Legal metrologists play a critical role in ensuring the integrity and accuracy of measurement in the Canadian marketplace. One of their key roles is to examine and certify new measurement devices being pushed into the Canadian marketplace to ensure they are up to Canadian regulations and standards. Legal metrology is broken down into four main disciplines at Measurement Canada:</p>

<ol class="pg-list">
  <li>Gravimetric (Mass)</li>
  <li>Volumetric</li>
  <li>Electricity</li>
  <li>Gas</li>
</ol>

<p>We have been working with the Gas team to figure out how we can apply agile practices to achieve two key goals:</p>

<ol class="pg-list">
  <li>Increase device certification and calibration throughput</li>
  <li>Building processes to enable more collaboration</li>
</ol>

<h2 class="section-heading">How did we help the Gas team?</h2>
<p>We sat down with the team to better understand the current challenges. We learned that device approvals are very complicated, and can take as long as a month or even more for each device! Through our discussion, we walked the Gas team through four things:
</p>

<ol class="pg-list">
  <li>Introduced scrum methodology</li>
  	<ol type="a">
    	<li>A time-boxed way of working</li>
    </ol>
  <li>Mapped the scrum team structure to the Gas lab roles </li>
    <ol type="a">
    	<li>Product Owner & Scrum Master -> Lab Manager </li>
      <li>Team of Devs -> Team of Metrologists</li>
    </ol>
  <li>Identified potential software tools to assist the transition</li>
  	<ol type="a">
        <li>e.g Trello, Jira, and Confluence</li>
    </ol>
  <li>Highlighted key agile rituals</li>
    <ol type="a">
      <li>Standups, Sprint Planning and Retrospective</li>
    </ol>
</ol>
