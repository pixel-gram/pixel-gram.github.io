<h3>Hey Measurement Canada!</h3>

<p>
We hope you are all doing well and staying safe. Last month we hosted our second lunch and learn, and we’d like to thank everyone for their continued support.
</p>

<p>
At the lunch and learn, we shared some useful tips and tools for working productively from home. Because some of you weren't able to join us, we will be highlighting the discussion in this post. You can also view the full deck here! 
</p>

<p>
Before we jump into the meat and potatoes, we want to acknowledge that:
</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote" style="text-align:center;">Not everything presented here will work for everyone and that’s okay!</blockquote>

<p>
The tips and tools suggested in this post are those that have worked for us, but are by no means definitive answers. If some of them don't work for you, keep experimenting to find the ones that do!
</p>
