<h3>Hey Measurement Canada!</h3>

<p>
We hope you are all doing well and staying safe. Last month we hosted our second lunch and learn, and we’d like to thank everyone for their continued support.
  
At the lunch and learn, we shared some useful tips and tools for working productively from home. Because some of you weren't able to join us, we will be highlighting the discussion in this post. You can also view the full deck here! 

Before we jump into the meat and potatoes, we want to acknowledge that:
</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote" style="text-align:center;">Not everything presented here will work for everyone and that’s okay!</blockquote>

<p>
The tips and tools suggested in this post are those that have worked for us, but are by no means definitive answers. If some of them don't work for you, keep experimenting to find the ones that do!
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Part 1: Tips on working from home</h2>
<h3 class="section-heading">Communicate, communicate, communicate!</h3>

<p>
Clear communication is very important when working from home. Unlike the office environment, everyone is working in their own space, making collaboration and communication a lot harder. 

To help mitigate this issue, we suggest using one primary channel of communication within your team with established core hours. This way, everyone knows how and when to reach everyone else.

When you want to meet with your colleagues, it’s best to do so over a video conference so that you don’t lose the nuances of facial expression and body language that you usually get when speaking to them in person. We highly suggest using your smartphone or personal computer for video calls to avoid overloading the GCSRA network. Using Microsoft Teams for your virtual meeting is an excellent option, as it doesn’t require a connection to GCSRA. 

When working remotely from home, communication tends to be intermittent as people are often not available at the same time. Therefore, it’s best to over communicate and follow up frequently with colleagues. It's also important that everyone is aware of when their teammates are available and when they aren’t.

<h3 class="section-heading">Imitate the office!</h3>

<p>
When working from home, we lose a lot of the day-to-day routine and social interactions that we had when working from the office. Many people really love the flexibility that comes with working remotely, especially in the early stages; however, the lack of structure and routine can begin weighing heavily as time goes on. 

What I found has helped me is pretending that I am going into the office. For me, this means wearing nicer clothes, which is of tremendous help to get me into the “I'm going to go to work” mindset. 

It also helps to create a comfortable workspace, ideally at a table or desk in an area with as little distraction and as much privacy as possible. This not only helps to stay productive, but it helps set a clearer boundary between personal and professional activities and can prevent overworking and burnout.
 
Last, but not least, to make up for the lack of socializing, we highly encourage you to reach out to your coworkers for impromptu chats or to schedule lunches so you can catch up.

<h3 class="section-heading">Imitate the office!</h3>
<p>
It’s so easy to get distracted when working from home, especially if there are other family members present.

When I first started working from home, I found it very hard to focus and get into the work mindset. What helped me was having a daily list of tasks that needed to get done and completing them one by one. 

It’s important to set up a daily routine to create habits that make it easier over time to get into and out of work mode. My morning ritual, for example, is to have a cup of tea, check in with my teammates and then play some music to get into the work mindset. 

It also helps to take breaks throughout the day to give your brain a few minutes to refresh itself.

<h2 class="section-heading">Part 2: Tools for working from home</h2>
<p>
Here are three tools that can help you work more effectively while working from home:

<ul>
  <li>Microsoft Teams</li>
  <li>Miro</li>
  <li>FunRetro</li>
</ul>

Each of these tools promote collaborative workflow between teams, particularly for dispersed teams. Before using them for work, please make sure to check with your managers that they are compliant with ISED’s requirements.
