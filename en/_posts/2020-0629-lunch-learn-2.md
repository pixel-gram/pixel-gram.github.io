<h3>Hey Measurement Canada!</h3>

<p>
We hope you are all doing well and staying safe. Last month we hosted our second lunch and learn, and we’d like to thank everyone for their continued support.
  
At the lunch and learn, we shared some useful tips and tools for working productively from home. Because some of you weren't able to join us, we will be highlighting the discussion in this post. You can also view the full deck here! 

Before we jump into the meat and potatoes, we want to acknowledge that:
</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote" style="text-align:center;">Not everything presented here will work for everyone and that’s okay!</blockquote>

<p>
The tips and tools suggested in this post are those that have worked for us, but are by no means definitive answers. If some of them don't work for you, keep experimenting to find the ones that do!

<h3 class="section-heading">Communicate, communicate, communicate!</h3>

<p>
Clear communication is very important when working from home. Unlike the office environment, everyone is working in their own space, making collaboration and communication a lot harder. 

To help mitigate this issue, we suggest using one primary channel of communication within your team with established core hours. This way, everyone knows how and when to reach everyone else.

When you want to meet with your colleagues, it’s best to do so over a video conference so that you don’t lose the nuances of facial expression and body language that you usually get when speaking to them in person. We highly suggest using your smartphone or personal computer for video calls to avoid overloading the GCSRA network. Using Microsoft Teams for your virtual meeting is an excellent option, as it doesn’t require a connection to GCSRA. 

When working remotely from home, communication tends to be intermittent as people are often not available at the same time. Therefore, it’s best to over communicate and follow up frequently with colleagues. It's also important that everyone is aware of when their teammates are available and when they aren’t.
